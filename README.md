## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the TechFit web application locally, you will need to have **XAMPP** (or a similar local web server environment with PHP and MySQL) installed and running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

* **XAMPP:** Download and install XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Ensure Apache and MySQL services are running.

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up TechFit on your local machine:

1.  **Extract Project Files:**
    * Download and extract the project `.zip` file. This will typically create two items: a folder named `Techfit` (containing the web application files) and a database file named `techfit.sql`.
    * Alternatively, you can clone the repository using Git:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/KhongCL/Techfit.git
        ```

2.  **Import Database:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    * In phpMyAdmin, click on the "Databases" tab or select "New" from the left sidebar to create a new database.
    * **Create a new database named `techfit`**.
    * Select the newly created `techfit` database from the left sidebar.
    * Go to the "Import" tab.
    * Click "Choose File" and select the `techfit.sql` file from your extracted project.
    * Scroll down and click the "Import" button to import the database schema and data.

3.  **Copy Website Folder:**
    * Copy the entire `Techfit` directory (the one containing your `index.php`, `admin_login.php`, etc.)
    * Paste it into your XAMPP's web server document root, typically:
        * `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (for Windows)
        * `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/` (for macOS)
        * `/opt/lampp/htdocs/` (for Linux)

4.  **Access the Application:**
    * Ensure that **Apache** and **MySQL** services are started in your XAMPP Control Panel.
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the following URLs:
        * **General Website (Job Seeker/Employer Login/Register):**
            `http://localhost/Techfit/`
        * **Admin Login:**
            `http://localhost/Techfit/admin_login.php?key=techfit`
        * **Admin Register:**
            `http://localhost/Techfit/admin_register.php?key=techfit`
